# Hyperscaler to OCI Migrations

## Introduction 
In the past years this architects team and it's predecessors have migrated many applications and databases from a non-Oracle Hyperscaler to OCI. We currently focus on Amazon, Google and Azure but we are not limiting ourselves to these three. Redhat Openshift, Digital Ocean, Linode, Ali Baba are just a few of the 2nd priority Hyperscalers that we are willing to work with in order to get your workloads migrated to OCI.
